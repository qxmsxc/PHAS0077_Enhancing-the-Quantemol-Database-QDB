Instructions for Running the Code
------------------
1. Make sure the dataset file **BURCAT_THR.xml** and the code file **MakeDatabase.py** are in the same directory when running the code.

2. The file **BURCAT_THR.xml** provided in this repository is not exactly the same as the original one in [Prof.Burcat's Thermodynamic Data Website](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9dAwAm4nIdCcXBsRG43YWVjX2M?resourcekey=0-lGW319qpm_UWttfRjSSWDQ). The file **BURCAT_THR.xml** provided in this repository is obtained after several manual modifications to the original file. The reasons why the manual modifications are inevitable and how to apply them are explained in details in the project report (section 3.4.).

 To guarantee that the code can run successfully, use the **BURCAT_THR.xml** provided in this repository instead of downloading it from [Prof.Burcat's Thermodynamic Data Website](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9dAwAm4nIdCcXBsRG43YWVjX2M?resourcekey=0-lGW319qpm_UWttfRjSSWDQ), or download the original file and manually modify it according to the project report (section 3.4.).

 3. The four .csv files are generated by the code. Among them, **Result_Database.csv** is the most important result dataset; **Isomers_NaN_HF298.csv** contains isomers without enthalpy of formation values; **Ref_Code.csv** is a match table for the reference codes with their corresponding full references; and **rough_database.csv** is a rough result, where duplicated substances still exist. For more detailed introduction of these files, please refer to the project report.
